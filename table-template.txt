Here is a generalized version.

The SQL template is

CREATE TABLE table_name (
    table_name_id         RAW(16) DEFAULT sys_guid() PRIMARY KEY,
    table_name                  VARCHAR2(4000),
    -- Additional columns for note and dates
    note                    VARCHAR2(4000),  -- General-purpose note field
    date_created            TIMESTAMP(9) WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT systimestamp(9) NOT NULL,
    date_updated            TIMESTAMP(9) WITH TIME ZONE,
        date_created_or_updated TIMESTAMP(9) WITH TIME ZONE GENERATED ALWAYS AS ( coalesce(date_updated, date_created) ) VIRTUAL
);

-- Trigger to update date_updated for operating_system
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER date_people_table_name BEFORE
    UPDATE ON table_name
    FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    :new.date_updated := systimestamp;
END;
